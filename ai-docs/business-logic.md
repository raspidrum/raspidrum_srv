# RaspiDrum Server - Business Logic

## Overview
RaspiDrum Server is a digital drum kit management system that allows musicians to control and customize electronic drum kits through MIDI interfaces. The system provides a flexible way to manage drum samples, presets, and real-time MIDI control.

## Core Business Concepts

### 1. Drum Kits
- Complete sets of drum samples
- Can be standard or custom kits
- Includes metadata (copyright, license, credits)
- Organized with tags for easy categorization

### 2. Instruments
- Individual drum components (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.)
- Support multiple variations through layers (e.g., different microphone positions)
- Configurable MIDI mappings
- Customizable controls for volume, pan, pitch, and other parameters

### 3. Presets
- Configurations that define how a kit is set up
- Channel routing for audio output
- MIDI control assignments
- Layer management for multi-sampled instruments
- Volume, pan, and effect settings per channel/instrument

## Key Features

### MIDI Integration
- Support for standard MIDI note mappings (GM, Alesis, etc.)
- Customizable MIDI CC controls for real-time parameter adjustment
- Multiple MIDI device support
- Dynamic MIDI mapping for different hardware configurations

### Audio Processing
- Multi-channel audio output support
- Per-channel volume and pan controls
- Layer-based sample management
- Integration with LinuxSampler for audio playback

### Preset Management
- Save and load complete drum kit configurations
- Channel-based routing system
- Instrument-specific parameter storage
